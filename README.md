# LLM Testing Framework using Promptfoo

A hands-on project to **evaluate and compare multiple Large Language Models (LLMs)** using [Promptfoo](https://promptfoo.dev/).  
This project benchmarks two **local AI models â€“ Gemma 2B and Mistral 7B** â€“ by testing them with structured prompts and analyzing their outputs side by side.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand how different **AI models** respond to the same prompts and measure differences in:
- Explanation clarity  
- Factual accuracy  
- Contextual reasoning  
- Simplicity and tone

All tests are performed **locally** using [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/), ensuring privacy and full control over the evaluation process.
